database are best suited for the user. 


WHY IS THE PROJECT USEFUL:
The project is useful because it allows me as the student to see how using simple logic 
I can make my program make simple prodictions. By comparing the score of the user and 
to the scores of the available daters and determining which one is closer, I can make 
a prediction of who would be most compatible with the user.
